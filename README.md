# face-recognition
in #face is as same as main, first read the dataset. 
then from #lbph use lbph function to calculate local binary pattern of dataset.
after that we have #findface to see wether there is any face in the image that user enter or not. we determine that with flag.
flag is boolean.
again, with #lbph process local binary pattern of the entered image
now we have both histogram of dataset and entered image. now we can make compare
